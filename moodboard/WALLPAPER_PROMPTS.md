## Wide wallpaper (16:9)

```
Post-Soviet brutalist urban landscape at night, isometric diorama view from above, crumbling panelka apartment blocks with uniform grid windows, some broken and boarded up, exposed rebar and water-stained concrete facades, narrow courtyards between prefab housing blocks, cracked asphalt streets with weeds pushing through, rusted playground equipment in a courtyard, chaotic overhead electrical wires, satellite dishes bolted to balconies, harsh institutional floodlights cutting through thick smog and tear gas haze, riot barriers and jersey walls blocking intersections, black-and-yellow hazard stripes on barricades, surveillance cameras on poles, propaganda banners hanging from buildings, distant orange glow of fires on the horizon, smoke plumes rising against a polluted amber-gray sky, puddles reflecting harsh lights, burned-out vehicle husks, scattered protest signs and debris, chain-link fences topped with razor wire, oppressive atmosphere, desaturated muted color palette dominated by concrete grays and gunmetal with warning amber and emergency red accents only, smog-choked, cinematic lighting, no people visible, eerie abandoned tension

## Phone wallpaper (9:16 portrait)

```
Towering post-Soviet panelka apartment block at night seen from street level looking up, brutalist concrete facade with grid pattern windows stretching into smog, broken windows with jagged glass, water stains streaking down crumbling prefab panels, exposed utility pipes, harsh fluorescent light spilling from a few occupied windows, thick tear gas haze drifting between buildings, single floodlight beam cutting diagonally through the smoke from above, surveillance camera silhouette mounted on corner, propaganda poster partially torn on the wall, black-and-yellow hazard tape across a doorway, cracked pavement foreground with puddle reflecting the building, scattered debris and shell casings, overhead electrical wires silhouetted against polluted orange-gray sky, oppressive claustrophobic atmosphere, desaturated concrete grays with sparse warning amber accents, cinematic noir lighting, no people

## Desktop ultrawide (21:9)

```
Panoramic post-Soviet brutalist cityscape at night, wide establishing shot, rows of identical Khrushchyovka five-story apartment blocks receding into smog, brutalist government building in center with narrow windows and heavy concrete facade, riot barriers and concertina wire forming a perimeter around it, floodlights on the building casting harsh cones of light through thick haze, distant fires glowing orange on the horizon behind silhouetted panelka blocks, tear gas clouds hanging low over empty streets, burned-out bus and overturned car, graffiti-covered walls, broken street lamps with one still flickering, public address speakers mounted on poles, scattered protest signs on wet asphalt, smoke stacks in the far distance adding to the smog ceiling, entire scene bathed in desaturated gunmetal grays with only amber floodlights and distant fire glow providing warmth, oppressive surveillance state atmosphere, urban decay, cinematic wide shot
